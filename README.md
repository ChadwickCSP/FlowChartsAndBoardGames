# Flow Charts and Board Games

## Overview

In this project, you will dissect the game 5-2-1-1 and translate its
instructions into a flow chart that you will use to identify key components in
the source code of a computer implementation of the game.

Additionally, you will select another game of your choice and translate its
instructions into another flow chart that you will use to identify key
components that you would have to write if you were to create a computer
implementation.

## Milestone 1

Due Dates: **E Period** - Wednesday Sept 8th @ 11:59 PM **C Period** - Thursday
Sept 9th @ 11:59 PM

For Milestone 1, you must translate the rules for a 2 player game of 5-2-1-1
into a flow chart using the provided Entry Points, Processes, Decision,
Connectors, and Terminal blocks. For more information on each block, see
[Appendix A](#Appendix-A:-Flow-Chart-Components)

After completing the flow chart, you will examine the source code for a 5-2-1-1
simulator and identify components which show Sequences, Selection, and Iteration
matching those from your completed flow chart. For more information on Sequence,
Selection, and Iteration, see [Appendix B](#appendix-b:-keywords)

### 5-2-1-1 Flow Chart

* 5-2-1-1 Rules: [DOC](https://tinyurl.com/5211-rules)
* Flow Chart Components: [PDF](support/components.pdf)

The components provided in the PDF above contain everything necessary (and
likely more) to complete a flow chart of a 2 player version of 5-2-1-1. For this
milestone, you may work in groups of up to 3 students.

* The flow chart you create may only contain the components provided in the PDF
  above. You may not create your own blocks.
* The flow chart must either be hand drawn or assembled from cut outs using the
  PDF above.

### Identifying Sequences

### Identifying Selection

### Identifying Iteration

### Submitting Milestone 1

To submit Milestone 1, you should create a new folder in your project named `5211`. Within the folder, you should include a README.md file containing your identified Sequences, Selection, and Iteration. For help creating a properly formatted README.md file, see [Appendix C](#appendix-c:-readme.md). 

In addition to your README.md file, you should also include an image for each of your flow charts.

When all of your work has been committed and pushed, you will create a tag called milestone-1.

## Getting Help

All questions should be posted to the class Piazza Q&A. You are also encouraged
to help other students who post on Piazza. When you post your question, be sure
to include as many details as possible for reproducing the issue you're having.

Questions you should answer when asking a question include:

1. What are you trying to do?
2. What did you try?
3. What was the result?

Work hard to make sure the person trying to answer your question can reproduce
your error. Share your files so others can run exactly what you're running.

Also, include screenshot / pictures if applicable.

Formulating good questions is a good life long skill. You should try asking your
question on Piazza before seeking out synchronous time with Mx. Collard.
However, if you would like to meet to discuss synchronously, first, look at [Mx.
Collard's Calendar](http://tinyurl.com/collard-calendar), then send them an
email with at least two proposed times you would like to meet.
